 The PCB's are prepared for use in [JMadison's PCB Test Fixture](https://thingiverse.com/thing:3592328). However, since the PCB's are a bit longer I have modified the bottom part and also made it available on [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com/thing:4767833).

Instructions for printing can be found in the respective pages.
